# A rookie’s first shot

In my experience, the simplest decisions often reveal the most about who we are, at any given point in time.

On October 29, 2003, 18-year-old LeBron James made his first shot decision as an NBA player. It wasn’t a flashy dunk or a deep three. It was a mid-range jumper - plain, efficient, unremarkable. Two points.

But that single shot spoke volumes. It told us what basketball was in 2003: a game that valued size and strength, rewarded mid-range specialists, and treated the three-point line as an occasional luxury.

Fast forward 20 years, and that same decision would look out of place. Today’s NBA is unrecognizable. Three-pointers aren’t just common - they’re necessary. Mid-range shots are now basketball’s version of a landline phone: technically still around, but rarely used.

LeBron’s first shot wasn’t just the start of his career. It was a snapshot of a moment in time. And what’s fascinating is how his evolution mirrors the evolution of the league itself. His choices on the court became a masterclass in adaptation.

This is the story of how LeBron’s shot selection changed over two decades, and how those choices reflect the shifting forces that reshaped the game of basketball.

# 2003-2008: The power of playing to your strengths

In LeBron’s early years, the game was simple: get to the basket.

He was faster, stronger, and more athletic than most players on the court. Why take a risky three-pointer when you could bulldoze your way to the rim? Over 40% of his shots came from the paint, where he was nearly unstoppable.

The mid-range jumper - like the one he made in his first game - was his secondary weapon. And it worked because it fit the league’s style. Coaches weren’t chasing efficiency metrics yet. The paint and mid-range were where championships were won.

LeBron wasn’t just playing basketball. He was thriving in a system built for players like him. The lesson? Success often comes from maximizing what works in the moment, even if it won’t last forever.

# 2009-2015: Learning to adapt

By 2009, the NBA was changing. The three-point revolution, sparked by analytics and players like Stephen Curry, was underway. LeBron noticed.

He didn’t immediately abandon the mid-range game - it was still part of his identity - but he started taking more three-pointers. Slowly, deliberately, he added them to his repertoire. By the time he joined the Miami Heat in 2010, and with the influence of teammates like Ray Allen who joined the Heat in 2012, his three-point attempts had grown to 25% of his total shots.

This wasn’t just about skill development. It was about survival. The game was evolving, and players who clung to the old ways risked falling behind.

LeBron’s willingness to adapt showed a crucial insight: the best performers don’t just play their game -they adjust to the rules as they change.

# 2016-2024: Embracing the new reality

The modern NBA belongs to the three-pointer, and so does LeBron.

Between 2016 and 2023, over 35% of his shots came from beyond the arc. The mid-range? Almost gone. The paint? Still important, but less dominant than before.

This wasn’t a concession—it was a strategy. LeBron didn’t stop attacking the basket. He just became more selective, choosing to drive when it mattered most and saving his energy for long-range daggers.

The league had fully transitioned to an era of spacing and efficiency. Teams weren’t just tolerating three-pointers—they were building offenses around them. LeBron’s game evolved accordingly.

The takeaway here is simple: the ability to change isn’t a weakness. It’s a competitive advantage

![LeBron's shot choices (2016-2024) : The shift isn't just about LeBron. The NBA's average number of three-point attempts per game has more than doubled since his rookie year. The league has transitioned from a post-centric style to a perimeter-oriented game](assets/lebron_linechart_16_24_v2.gif)

# LeBron as a mirror to the NBA

LeBron’s career isn’t just about scoring points. It’s about reflecting the game’s evolution.

The mid-range game, once the foundation of basketball, is now a relic. Analytics proved that long-range shots and finishes at the rim were more valuable, and the league responded. LeBron’s shift from mid-range jumpers to three-pointers wasn’t just personal growth - it was basketball growth.

Consider this: In 2003, NBA teams averaged just 14 three-point attempts per game. By 2023, that number had more than doubled to 35. LeBron adapted not because he wanted to - but because he had to.

  )

# Step 3: Merge LeBron's and league-wide data
trend_data <- left_join(lebron_3pt, league_3pt, by = "yearSeason")

# Step 4: Create the line chart - to be done later

```

The NBA’s greatest players aren’t just defined by their talent. They’re defined by how well they adjust when the rules of the game change.

# What his journey can teach us

LeBron’s evolution is a lesson in adaptability. He started his career mastering the tools of his era. Then, as the game changed, he didn’t resist - he evolved with it.

For players entering the league today, the message is clear: success isn’t just about being great at one thing. It’s about being willing to reinvent yourself when the world around you changes.

LeBron’s journey isn’t just about basketball. It’s about the universal truth that staying relevant requires constant evolution. The game always changes. The question is whether you’ll change with it.

I believe that when its all said and done, LeBron’s legacy won't just about his stats or his championships. It’s about his adaptability.

Over 20 years, he’s played in a league that’s transformed itself multiple times. Each time, LeBron transformed with it, redefining what it means to be great in basketball.

The King’s reign is a testament to one simple idea: if you want to last, you have to evolve.
